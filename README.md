# CST 370 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

[Homework 2-1](./main_hw2_1.cpp): Write a C++ program (or Java program) for hw2_1 that reads input numbers from a user and displays the closest distance between two numbers among all input numbers. 

[Homework 2-2](./main_hw2_2.cpp): Write a C++ (or Java) program for hw2_2 which checks if an input string is a palindrome or not. In the problem, a palindrome means an alphanumeric string which reads the same front to back. For the problem, you should ignore case in the alphanumeric input string. Also, you should ignore symbols such as !, @, #, etc. In other words, you should consider only English letters and numbers in the input string. For example, “Racecar”, “IdiddidI”, “78!Dontnod8@7” are all palindromes. But “CSUMBUSC” is not a palindrome.  
[Homework 3-1](./main_hw3_1.cpp): Write a C++ program (or Java program) for hw3_1 that reads the number of input values from a user. Then, read the input values from the user. After that, your program should display them in the ascending order. When you display the numbers, you have to use a short representation if there are consecutive numbers. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, you have to display them 51–53 to save space. For the assignment, you can assume that the input values are positive integers and unique (= No duplications in the input numbers).
